## How to Use This Example

### 1. Visual Reference

Open the file to see:
- **Slide layouts**: Image-left, text-right format
- **Color palette**: Dark blue (0,32,96), accent blue (0,114,198), beige (245,239,231)
- **Typography**: Segoe UI, 24pt headlines, 14pt body
- **Spacing**: Adequate white space, 2-3 insights per slide

### 2. Headline Inspiration

Study how headlines are crafted:

❌ **Descriptive (Avoid):** "Agent Usage Trends"
✅ **Insight-driven (Use):** "87% of Agent users remain infrequent - usage has not embedded into workflows"

The pattern: **[Data point] → [Implication] → [So what]**

### 3. Content Structure

Each content slide follows:
1. **Compelling headline** (insight + implication)
2. **Dashboard screenshot** (left side, with blue border)
3. **2-3 insights** (right side, source-grounded)

### 4. Storyboard Flow

Notice the narrative arc:
- **Act 1:** Problem identification (adoption gap)
- **Act 2:** Deep dive into root causes (habit formation, single use case)
- **Act 3:** Actionable solutions (3 specific actions)
- **Conclusion:** Expected outcomes and metrics

## Key Constitution Principles Demonstrated

### Section 3.5: Executive Focus
✅ 2-3 insights per slide (not overcrowded)
✅ Clear "so what" on every slide

### Section 4: Headline Standards
✅ Insight-driven, not descriptive
✅ Emphasizes implications and actionability
✅ Complete thoughts, not labels

### Section 6: Source Fidelity
✅ All data points from dashboard (4,381 users, 96%, 87%, etc.)
✅ No external benchmarks or industry norms added
✅ Source timestamp included (1/23/2026)

### Section 7: Image Usage
✅ Aspect ratio maintained
✅ Blue borders (2pt)
✅ Max 70% screen width
✅ Image-left, text-right layout

### Section 8: Visual Consistency
✅ Wide format 16:9
✅ Consistent color palette throughout
✅ Professional spacing and hierarchy

## Using as Your Template

### Option 1: Extract Corporate Colors

If this color scheme works for you:
- Dark Blue: RGB(0, 32, 96)
- Accent Blue: RGB(0, 114, 198)
- Beige Background: RGB(245, 239, 231)

### Option 2: Substitute Your Colors

Keep the structure but update Section 10 in the constitution with your corporate palette.

### Option 3: Learn the Pattern

Study this example then create presentations that match your brand while following the same quality standards.

## Insights Quality Benchmark

The example shows how to transform dashboard observations into executive insights:

**Dashboard shows:** "180 Agent users, 4,381 total Copilot users"

**Weak insight:** "Low Agent adoption compared to Copilot"

**Strong insight (from example):** "96% of Copilot users have never tried Agents - massive awareness and adoption gap requiring immediate intervention"

**Why it's strong:**
- Specific percentage (96%)
- Clear implication (awareness gap)
- Actionable language (requiring immediate intervention)
- Executive framing (so what: we need to act)

## Compare Your Output

After generating your first deck with Claude Code:

1. Open your output alongside `Example-Storyboard-Analytics.pptx`
2. Compare:
   - Are your headlines insight-driven?
   - Do you have 2-3 insights per slide?
   - Is the storyboard narrative clear?
   - Are visuals properly formatted?
3. Iterate with Claude Code to match quality
