# Platform & Feature Analysis - Before vs After Examples

This document shows how platform/feature analysis improves insight quality.

---

## Example 1: Copilot Overall Trends

### ❌ Before (Department-focused only)
**Headline:** "134 Agent users from 1,275 total (11%) - significant opportunity to expand automation adoption"

**Insights:**
- Agent adoption at 11% while web chat reaches 1,275 users shows strong platform engagement
- HR Generalists (140 actions/user) are 3-4x above average - great candidates to champion agent adoption
- Client Delivery's concentration positions them as ideal pilot group for scaling agent workflows

**Missing:** No mention of M365 Copilot showing zero adoption, or why web chat dominates

### ✅ After (Department + Platform patterns)
**Headline:** "Web Chat dominates with 1,275 users while M365 Copilot shows zero - integration gap to address"

**Insights:**
- Web-based chat engagement (1,275 users, 38 prompts/user) proves demand exists, but M365 integrated version shows zero adoption - integration or discovery barrier preventing embedded workflow usage
- Agent platform reaches only 134 users (11%) despite automation potential - users defaulting to familiar chat interface rather than exploring agent capabilities
- HR Generalists achieve 140 actions/user across web chat - opportunity to introduce them to M365 integrated experience for seamless workflow embedding

**Improvement:** Now identifies that the issue is platform/integration-specific, not just adoption-general

## Example 2: Agents Leaderboard

### ❌ Before (Department-focused only)
**Headline:** "63 users concentrated on Draft as IP Agent (546 actions) - successful use case to build on"

**Insights:**
- Draft as IP Agent captures 68% of agent usage with 546 actions - validates the agent platform
- Darren Li created top 2 agents demonstrating internal expertise to mentor other builders
- Content Governance (3 users) engaged with agents - natural partners for expanding catalog

**Missing:** What makes "Draft as IP Agent" successful? What does it do? Why does it resonate?

### ✅ After (Department + Feature patterns)
**Headline:** "Draft as IP Agent dominates with 546 actions (68% of total) - IP document automation resonates"

**Insights:**
- Draft as IP Agent's document automation workflow (546 actions, 63 users) outperforms other agents 7x - IP documentation is high-value repetitive task ideal for agent automation
- Agent feature concentration (68% on single use case) shows users need clear, specific workflow solutions rather than general-purpose agents - replicate with procurement automation, briefing creation, and contract review agents
- Outlook integration agents (OutlookDraftsChatSteering: 87 actions) and file-based agents (Brief Validation: 70 actions) show secondary traction - email and document workflows are natural agent entry points

**Improvement:** Now explains WHY the agent succeeds (IP automation workflow) and identifies the pattern (specific workflows > general purpose)

## Example 3: Platform/Feature Comparison Dashboard

### ❌ Before (Missing platform analysis)
**Headline:** "Usage varies across different departments and teams"

**Insights:**
- Different teams show different engagement levels
- Some platforms are used more than others
- Opportunity to identify successful patterns

**Problem:** Completely generic, no actionable insights

### ✅ After (Platform-focused)
**Headline:** "PowerPoint Copilot leads with 450 actions while Excel shows 89 - content creation drives value"

**Insights:**
- PowerPoint integration (450 actions, 120 users) achieves 5x higher engagement than Excel (89 actions, 45 users) - content creation and presentation workflows deliver immediate value vs. analytical workflows still finding use cases
- Teams-integrated Copilot (340 actions) outperforms Outlook (156 actions) 2:1 - collaborative meeting contexts generate more prompts than individual email composition
- Word document assistance (280 actions) concentrated in HR and Legal departments - long-form content creation is proven use case to expand to Marketing and Communications teams

**Improvement:** Specific platform comparisons reveal which integrations work and why

---

## Example 4: Habit Formation

### ❌ Before (Generic frequency analysis)
**Headline:** "Usage frequency patterns show opportunities for increased engagement"

**Insights:**
- Some users are frequent while others are infrequent
- Opportunity to move users from light to heavy usage
- Champion programs can help drive adoption

**Problem:** No specifics about which platforms or features

### ✅ After (Platform-specific frequency)
**Headline:** "Teams Copilot achieves 18 daily active users while Outlook shows 4 - meeting workflows embed better"

**Insights:**
- Teams integration shows 18 daily active users with 8+ prompts per session - live meeting context (summarization, action items) creates natural habit formation vs. asynchronous email workflows
- PowerPoint daily users (12) concentrate in Client Delivery and HR - presentation deadlines drive consistent usage patterns to replicate in other content-heavy departments
- Excel Copilot shows 3 daily users despite 45 monthly actives - formula assistance valued but not yet daily habit, needs workflow embedding through templates and training

**Improvement:** Platform-specific frequency reveals which integrations succeed at habit formation and why

## Key Patterns to Identify

### Platform Concentration
- Which Microsoft 365 app has highest engagement?
- Is usage concentrated in one platform or distributed?
- What does concentration reveal about workflow value?

### Integration Success/Failure
- Web vs. integrated versions - which wins?
- Standalone vs. embedded - adoption patterns?
- Cross-platform usage - users adopting multiple integrations?

### Feature Differentiation
- Chat vs. Agents - which capabilities resonate?
- Composition vs. Analysis - which workflows more valuable?
- Synchronous (Teams) vs. Asynchronous (Email) - habit formation differences?

### Workflow Inference
- PowerPoint high engagement → Content creation workflows
- Teams high engagement → Collaborative meeting workflows
- Excel low engagement → Analytical use cases still emerging
- Outlook moderate engagement → Email assistance valued but not transformative

## Implementation Checklist

When analyzing dashboards, always ask:

**Platform Questions:**
- [ ] Which Microsoft 365 apps are mentioned?
- [ ] What are the usage numbers for each platform?
- [ ] Which platform shows highest engagement?
- [ ] Are there platform concentration patterns?

**Feature Questions:**
- [ ] Which Copilot features are shown (Chat, Agents, M365 integration)?
- [ ] How does usage compare across features?
- [ ] Which features drive the most value?
- [ ] Are there feature adoption gaps?

**Integration Questions:**
- [ ] Web vs. desktop vs. mobile - which interface wins?
- [ ] Standalone vs. embedded - adoption differences?
- [ ] Cross-app patterns - do users adopt multiple integrations?

**Workflow Questions:**
- [ ] What do platform patterns reveal about workflows?
- [ ] Which use cases are succeeding vs. struggling?
- [ ] Where is integration working vs. failing?
- [ ] What recommendations follow from platform insights?

## Summary

**Old approach:** Focus only on departments/orgs → Miss half the story

**New approach:** Analyze departments + platforms + features → Complete picture

**Result:** Insights now reveal:
- Which workflows deliver value (content creation > analysis)
- Which integrations work (Teams > Outlook)
- Where to focus enablement (successful platforms first)
- What patterns to replicate (specific workflows > general purpose)

This platform-aware analysis makes insights significantly more actionable for IT decision makers.
